# Predict-Product-Categories-and-Brands-Using-CLIP-Embeddings
In this project, we aim to classify product categories (based on the Google taxonomy) and brands using fine-tuned CLIP embeddings. Our primary focus will be on aggregating textual and image embeddings to achieve a more representative depiction of the products, leading to enhanced performance.
